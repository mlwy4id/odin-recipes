      <h2>Indonesian authentic chicken satay</h2>
      <p>
        Sate is basically a meat or sometimes offals skewered on bamboo sticks
        and then grilled. They are usually served with sauce. Many people think
        that when it comes to sate, the sauce that comes with it is usually
        peanut based.

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Make a paste from garlic, turmeric, palm sugar, salt, and lime leaves
          (3). Marinate the diced chicken with the paste and add lemon juice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Marinate it for 2-3 hours, then arrange the marinated chicken into the
          skewer. The more you put the chicken in the skewer the less satay you
          will get.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make the paste from the onion, garlic, Thai chili, candlenuts, and
          salt. Grind the peanuts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat the saucepan with oil then saute the onion-garlic paste. Once
          it wilted add the peanut ground.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then add the coconut milk, tamarind water, and sweet soy sauce. Cook
          it till it boiled and became like a porridge (after 15-20 minutes the
          liquid will decrease).
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix all the barbecue sauce ingredients then dip the skewered chicken
          and grill (I use toaster or you can use the grilled) it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn the skewered chicken on both sides, then dip it in the peanuts
          sauce and grill it again till it cooks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Chicken satay is ready to serve with rice or lontong (plain rice
          cooked using banana leaves), peanuts sauce, added topping Thai chili
          and acar (Indonesian pickle).
        </li>
      </ol>
