      <h2>Indonesian chicken noodle soup</h2>
      <p>
        Soto ayam is unto itself. Most classic noodle soups are. Each has its
        distinctive broth. Toppings. Noodles. Spicing. You can take a trip
        around the world on noodle soup. You could serve it as an appetizer. A
        cup of soup. But it comes into its own as the star. A big bowl of hot
        noodles in broth. A generous portion of the lemongrass infused fried
        chicken. A perfect medium boiled egg.

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Season the chicken thighs or drumsticks generously with salt and
          pepper. Let them sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat 3 tablespoons of cooking oil in a stockpot over medium-high heat.
          Sear the chicken for about 3 minutes per side until golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour in 4 cups of chicken stock and 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil
          over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and let it simmer for
          30 minutes, skimming any impurities from the surface occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the broth is ready, remove the chicken from the pot and let it
          cool. Shred the meat into bite-sized pieces and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a blender or food processor, combine lemongrass, shallots, garlic,
          ginger, turmeric, coriander, cumin, candlenuts, and cooking oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Blend until smooth. If the mixture is too dry, add 1 tablespoon of oil
          or water at a time until it reaches a thick paste consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
          This recipe yields about 1¼ cups of spice paste, enough for two
          batches of Soto Ayam. Use 5 tablespoons for one batch and store the
          remaining paste in the freezer for future use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat 2 tablespoons of cooking oil in a large saucepan over medium
          heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add 5 tablespoons of the spice paste and stir-fry for about 1 minute
          until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>Pour in the chicken broth and stir in ½ cup of coconut milk.</li>
        <li>
          Lower the heat and let it simmer for 10 minutes to allow the flavors
          to meld.
        </li>
        <li>
          Blanch the dry rice vermicelli noodles in boiling water for 2–3
          minutes until al dente. Drain and divide the noodles among 4 serving
          bowls.
        </li>
        <li>Ladle the hot chicken soup over the noodles.</li>
        <li>
          Top with shredded chicken, hard-boiled egg, fresh bean sprouts, crispy
          shallots, and cilantro.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve with lime wedges, fresh red chili, and sambal oelek on the side.
          Enjoy!
